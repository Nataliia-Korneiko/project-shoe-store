                Releasedate: 01.11.2019 | Online: 09:00 CET. In 1982, the Nike
                Air Force 1 was introduced to the market for the first time! It
                is the Nike sneaker which probably enjoys the highest
                recognition, not at least because he was celebrated in the
                hip-hop scene for decades like no other sneaker. Now, Nike has
                teamed up with GORE-TEX to retool the classic silhouette with a
                street-approved design that meets the standards of GORE-TEX
                waterproof technology. A mixture of textile and full-grain
                leather on the upper adds breathability and gives a premium
                look, while the GORE-TEX inner sleeve keeps the foot warm, snug
                and dry. But thats not all: this Air Force 1 also features
                water-wicking flat laces and an outstanding GORE-TEX branding on
                the heel. ++++++++ Description After receiving a few initial
                teases of Nike‘s latest usage of GORE-TEX, we now have a closer
                look at the two all-weather reworks of the Air Force 1 set to
                release. The Air Force 1 High “GORE-TEX” is part of Nike’s “The
                10th” series which is dedicated to co-founder Bill Bowerman and
                his contributions to the world of sports, while the Low serves
                as a weatherproof update to the lifestyle model. The high-top
                height iteration draws inspiration from duck boots marked by a
                reinforced toe box tied to the upper constructed of smooth
                premium and ballistic nylon. Stripping back the ankle region,
                the upper portion of the shoe has been replaced by a zipper
                bootie liner complete with rear toggles attached to a rugged
                heel tab and marked with a “The 10th” badge. Rounding up the
                design of the shoe is a trail-style lacing system paired with a
                zipped tongue, tacked on midfoot Swooshes, GORE-TEX heel
                embroidery and a contrast AF1 sole unit. Opting for a more
                subtle rugged revamp, the low-top take is defined by an upper
                sporting a distinct mix of smooth premium and ballistic nylon
                highlighting the simple panel design of the shoe. Breaking up
                the tonal look is Nike Air embroidery at the rear, GORE-TEX heel
                markings and a co-branding badge on the tongue. A printed insole
                and contrast AF1 sole unit finishes the design of the low-top
                rugged reimagination. Priced at $150 and $200 USD respectively,
                the Nike Air Force 1 Low and High are set to release on nike.com
                and select retailers November 1. ++++++ Getting fully prepared
                for the colder seasons that will commence in just a few months
                time, Nike is once again turning to the element experts of
                Gore-Tex to reinforce this brand new assortment of Air Force 1
                Lows. The classic basketball sneaker gets transformed into a
                winterized necessity by upgrading its exteriors with a layer of
                Gore-Tex membranes that will keep your soles armored throughout
                the days of inclement weather. Four new colorways including a
                black, yellow, drab olive, and beige will be included in the
                collection, all featuring branding further alluding to its
                climatic upgrades via embroidery on the lateral heels, in
                addition to the tongues tabs. If you’re in the market for some
                functional footwear, you can expect these to drop at the below
                retailers on November 1st for $150 USD. See a detailed look of
                each pair here ahead. +++++ Prepped and ready to withstand
                whatever Mother Nature throws your way, the Air Force 1 Low
                GORE-TEX is blessed with the time-tested stylings we’ve come to
                know a love. Leather uppers deliver a familiar vibe, while the
                aforementioned waterproof yet breathable membrane is concealed
                underneath the outer-most layer. A gusseted tongue construction
                is built in without altering the fit, preventing water passage
                through exposed areas, and the traditional perforated finish is
                removed to ensure water can’t sneak get into any other gaps. And
                if that wasn’t enough armour for you, the textile vamp and
                quarter are polyester canvas treated with a non-wicking finish.
                +++++ Choose between a brooding black build or a militaristic
                melange in olive – both colourways equipped with the utilitarian
                aesthetic that’s currently engulfing the sneakersphere. The
                earthy tones are complemented with contrasting GORE-TEX branding
                hits towards the heel, and on a co-branded tongue, while the gum
                soles underpin the classic yet contemporary flair.
